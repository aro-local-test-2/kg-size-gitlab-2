/**
 * Event hub that replays past events to late subscribers.
 *
 * Subscribers of a buffered event type receive everything already emitted for
 * that type before they subscribed, and then live events as usual. Without
 * that, a reconnect or a component mounting mid-stream silently drops every
 * event delivered in the gap.
 *
 * Buffering is a property of the event type, declared once in the constructor,
 * so emitting is all a producer has to do. Each buffered type gets its own
 * bounded buffer; types not listed pass straight through.
