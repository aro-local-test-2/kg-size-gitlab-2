module SecretsManagement
  # Shared flow for SecretsManager Initialize services. Runs the SM-exists
  # guard, runs any scope-specific guards, then creates the SM record and
  # the `:provision` maintenance task in one transaction, enqueues the
  # async worker, and returns a scope-specific success payload.
  #
  # Anchoring the provision flow on a maintenance task gives the worker
  # the same crash-recovery guarantees the deprovision flow already has:
  # if the async worker dies, the task is left stale and the cron worker
  # retries it. The provision service is designed to be idempotent.
  #
  # The SM-exists guard runs in `execute` itself, not in the overridable
  # `ensure_secrets_manager_allowed_on_resource` hook, so subclasses
  # cannot accidentally skip it when they override that hook.
  #
  # Including classes must implement:
  # - `resource`                        -- project or group record
  # - `create_secrets_manager`          -- create + persist the SM record
  # - `create_maintenance_task(sm)`     -- create + persist the provision task
  # - `enqueue_provision_worker(task)`  -- async worker enqueue
  #
  # Including classes may override:
  # - `ensure_secrets_manager_allowed_on_resource` for additional guards
