module SecretsManagement
  module UserPermissions
    # Resolves the effective OpenBao capabilities for a user on a secrets manager resource.
    #
    # Uses the user-scoped client (CEL login with ProjectUserJwt / GroupUserJwt) to call
    # `sys/capabilities-self`, letting OpenBao compute the union of all applicable principal
    # policies (user, member-role, role).
    #
    # The controller (`check_read_capability!`), the GraphQL `userPermissions` resolver,
    # and the sidebar check added in !254694 all call this from separate requests, so the
    # OpenBao lookup (three round trips) is cached via `Gitlab::Cache.fetch_once` (Redis
    # for cross-request, SafeRequestStore within a request). Entitlement is re-applied on
    # every call because it changes independently of OpenBao; caching it would freeze a
    # billing decision.
    #
    # Path mapping (mirrors update_service_helpers.rb):
    #   - readMetadata  from `list` on the detailed-metadata path (detailed_metadata_path('*')),
    #     the path the secrets list service actually reads
    #   - createSecrets from `create` on the data path (ci_full_path('*'))
    #   - updateSecrets from `update` on the data path (ci_full_path('*'))
    #   - deleteSecrets from `delete` on the data path (ci_full_path('*'))
    #
    # `read_value` is intentionally not resolved here: it lives on a separate
    # `api_jwt` mount/policy (see !240364) that this user-scoped client does not
    # authenticate against. Its GraphQL exposure is tracked in #602726.
    #
    # Any OpenBao error is rescued and returns all-false (fail closed), and is
    # reported to Sentry once the secrets manager is active.
