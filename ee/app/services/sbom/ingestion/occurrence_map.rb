    # Data structure for tracking SBOM component state during ingestion.
    #
    # OccurrenceMap is the SBOM equivalent of {Security::Ingestion::FindingMap},
    # serving as the "message object" in the pipeline design pattern. It bridges
    # report data (from the CycloneDX parser) with database records, accumulating
    # IDs and state as it flows through ingestion tasks.
    #
    # == Pipeline Design Pattern
    #
    # During SBOM ingestion, an OccurrenceMap is created for each component in the
    # report. As it passes through tasks:
    #
    # 1. Starts with `report_component` and `report_source` from the parsed report
    # 2. Tasks populate `component_id`, `component_version_id`, `source_id` as
    #    records are created or found
    # 3. `occurrence_id` is set when the occurrence record is created
    # 4. `vulnerability_ids` accumulates if vulnerabilities are linked
    #
    # == Key Attributes
    #
    # Read-only (from report):
    # - `report_component` - The parsed component from CycloneDX (name, version, purl)
    # - `report_source` - The source context (dependency file, container image)
    #
    # Mutable (set by tasks):
    # - `component_id` - FK to sbom_components table
    # - `component_version_id` - FK to sbom_component_versions table
    # - `source_id` - FK to sbom_sources table
    # - `source_package_id` - FK to sbom_source_packages table
    # - `occurrence_id` - FK to sbom_occurrences table (created record)
    # - `uuid` - Unique identifier for the occurrence
    # - `vulnerability_ids` - Array of linked vulnerability IDs
    # - `occurrence_changed` - Flag indicating if occurrence was updated
    #
    # == Derived Data
    #
    # - `#to_h` - Returns attributes hash suitable for bulk insertion
    # - `#purl_type` - Package URL type from the component's purl
    # - `#packager` - Package manager (npm, gem, pip, etc.)
    # - `#input_file_path` - Path to the manifest file or container image ref
    #
    # @see Security::Ingestion::FindingMap for the security equivalent
    # @see OccurrenceMapCollection for the collection wrapper
    # @see IngestReportService for the orchestration layer
