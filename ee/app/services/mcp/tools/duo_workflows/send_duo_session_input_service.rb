            Answer a GitLab Duo Agent Platform session that is waiting on you: approve or reject a
            pending plan or tool call, or reply to a question the agent asked.

            Call get_duo_session first to see why the session paused and what it is asking. A session
            accepts input once its last CI job has finished, whether it is waiting in input_required,
            plan_approval_required, or tool_call_approval_required.

            The session continues asynchronously in a CI job that takes minutes to start. Poll
            get_duo_session with the same workflow_id to follow it.
