module Vulnerabilities
  module Reads
    # This class will update vulnerability reads for a set of corresponding vulnerability records
    # according to the passed attributes set.
    #
    # It can operate in two modes:
    # 1. Vulnerability-based (legacy): Pass vulnerabilities and it derives findings from them
    # 2. Finding-based (ref-aware): Pass findings directly to ensure context-specific
    #    interactions are propagated only to the correctly contexted vulnerability_read
    #
    # If any of the passed vulnerabilities does not have a corresponding read, it will ensure it
    # exists in the created state.
    #
    # If no attributes are passed, it will only ensure that the vulnerabilities have corresponding
    # vulnerability reads created.
