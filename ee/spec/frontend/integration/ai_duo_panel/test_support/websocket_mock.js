/**
 * Replaces `global.WebSocket` so Duo Agentic Chat's whole streaming layer runs for
 * real in integration tests: the workflow stream (subscriber fan-out, message
 * buffering, error escalation) and `stream_worker` (framing, decoding, the
 * open/close/error protocol) are the code under test, not doubles. Only the
 * transport is faked, which is the lowest seam available and lets a spec drive
 * frames directly; MSW handles HTTP here, not the websocket.
 *
 * `stream_worker` reads `WebSocket.OPEN` / `WebSocket.CONNECTING` off the global
 * constructor, so the fake carries those statics.
 *
 * ## Every spec must terminate the stream manager
 *
 * The workflow stream keeps its worker, subscribers, message buffer and connected
 * flag in module state, which outlives a component unmount and leaks into the
 * next test in the file. There is no way for this module to clean that up on a
 * spec's behalf, so each spec has to do it explicitly:
 *
 *     import { workflowStreamFactory } from 'ee/ai/duo_agentic_chat/websocket/workflow_stream_factory';
 *
 *     beforeEach(() => {
 *       installWebSocketMock();
 *     });
 *
 *     afterEach(() => {
 *       wrapper?.destroy();
 *       terminate();          // <- releases the worker and clears module state
 *       restoreWebSocket();
 *     });
 *
 * Skipping `terminate()` does not fail loudly; it surfaces as a later test in the
 * same file reusing a dead worker, or receiving a buffered checkpoint it never
 * pushed.
 *
 * ## A socket only exists once a prompt is sent
 *
 * `subscribe()` does not start the worker -- only `connect()` does,
 * which the state manager calls from `startWorkflow`. So a spec has to send a
 * prompt (or hydrate a RUNNING workflow) before `waitForSocket()` can resolve.
