# frozen_string_literal: true

# The fail-safe behaviour that EVERY partner token verifier must satisfy, whether
# it was hand-written or produced by the AI-assisted client generator. This is the
# safety net that lets us scale validity checks to many vendors without live
# tokens: even if we can never confirm the happy path for a vendor, we can always
# prove the client fails safe.
#
# Usage:
#   it_behaves_like 'a partner token client', http_method: :get
#
#   The including spec must also define `let(:valid_token) { ... }` - a
#   syntactically well-formed token for the vendor - since it's used by the
#   "unmapped/unexpected HTTP status" and "when a response is returned"
#   contexts to stub the HTTP call and drive `#verify_token`.
#   Omitting it raises a NameError.
#
#   Rejecting a shape is no longer part of this contract: the registry routes on
#   the rule id, so only AWS and GCP still screen their input, and both cover
#   that in their own specs.
