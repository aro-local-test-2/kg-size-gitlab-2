    # One firing point shared by every denial entry point: the GraphQL write
    # concern, the CI runner payload gate, the job-scheduling drop check and
    # the service-layer entitlement gate. Policy conditions deliberately do
    # not emit: they are pure
    # predicates re-run on speculative `can?` checks and type authorization,
    # which would pollute the metric with non-actions.

    # `mode` is always `enforce`: observe mode (would-deny telemetry without
    # enforcement) was deliberately skipped; the property is kept so
    # dashboards need no schema change if it lands later.
