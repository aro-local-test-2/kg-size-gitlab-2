      # Dataset-neutral connector for PDS (PMDB Distribution Service).
      #
      # Everything here belongs to the v3 distribution contract rather than to
      # one dataset: the request shapes, the instance token and identity headers,
      # snapshot and delta selection, per-shard resume, the delta cursor, the
      # registry identifier mapping and the per-registry skip when PDS rejects a
      # request. A subclass supplies only the unit primitive its instance token
      # must carry, the key its endpoints put the archive URL under, and the
      # label its log lines read with; the endpoint comes from
      # sync_config.base_uri.
      #
      # PDS authenticates the instance with an IJWT (Instance JWT) carrying the
      # dataset's scope and returns short-lived signed GCS URLs. The signed URLs
      # are self-authenticating, so the follow-up downloads carry no auth
      # headers. PDS does not name that field the same way on every endpoint, so
      # each subclass declares the key its own endpoints use.
      #
      # Endpoints (relative to sync_config.base_uri, one connector per PURL).
      # `<p>` is the PDS registry id (SyncConfiguration.registry_id, e.g.
      # gem -> rubygem), not the raw purl_type. See
      # https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/work_items/607045.
      #   GET {base_uri}/all?purl_type=<p>
      #     First sync. Returns { "until": <epoch>, "shards": [{ "shard": "00",
      #     "signed_url": ... }] } -- one signed URL per shard, each pointing at a
      #     <shard>.tar.zst; every shard shares the snapshot `until`.

      #     { "purl_types": { "<p>": [{ "delta": "<ts>", "signed_url": ... }] } };

      #     registry is up to date.

      # `gitlab_realm` claim) and X-Gitlab-Instance-Id (matching `sub`) are also
